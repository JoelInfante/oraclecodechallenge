<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Oracle code challenge project is made with the following descriptions:
 * Programming Language: Swift
 * UI - SwiftUI
 * UI Binding - Combine
 * Architecture - MVVM
 * Networking - URLSession
 * Unit Tests - XCTests

I chose swiftui 'cause it's a very powerful tool, clean but above all it is the future of views in ios development.
Therefore combine was used as a complement to make it reactive and this allows us to make a good binding between the view and the logic that are completely separated.
On the other hand, the architecture that best adapts to the needs of the same chosen tools is the mvvm architecture, which provides us with a separation of layers for different and specific tasks
being a project without complex logic allows us to choose any architecture that is more flexible and at the same time less complex.
